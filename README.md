# PRODIGY_CS_04
This project consists of a simple keylogger implemented in C++ (keylogger.cpp) and a corresponding Python server (server.py). The keylogger captures keystrokes from a Linux input device, encrypts them using a basic XOR cipher, and sends the encrypted data to a local server. The server decrypts and logs the keystrokes to a file.
